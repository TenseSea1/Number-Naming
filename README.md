# Number-Naming
Conversions are based on the modern short-scale number naming conventions as articulated by Conway and Guy. It can handle any rational number with finite decimal form, whether it be positive, negative, or zero. It can also handle numbers of the form "10^n" where n is an integer. Spaces and commas are ignored.
